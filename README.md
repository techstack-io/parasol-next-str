This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started and Contributing

1.  fork the repot found at https://github.com/techstack-io/parasol-next-str

2.  find a good place on your local computer and run the command `git clone https://github.com/techstack-io/parasol-next-str`

3.  `cd` into parasol-next-str directory and run `npm install`

4.  create a new branch with command `git checkout -b my_branch_name`

5.  run the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/techstack-io/parasol-next-str`

6.  open your text editor of choice ex: `code .` to bring up visual studio code

7.  run the command `npm run dev`

8.  make your changes

9. stop the development server with `control + c`

10. `git status`

11  `git add .`

12. `git commit -m "message describing the work performed"`

13. `git push -u origin my_branch_name`

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
